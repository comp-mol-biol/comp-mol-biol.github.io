We encourage developers to use our software and help us make it a stable, feature complete and reliable system. In order to achieve that goal, we ask you to report bugs as you find them.

Please read [how to make a good bug report](/community/bugs/make-a-good-bug-report/) before opening a new issue.

Mono uses GitHub for issue tracking: [https://github.com/mono/mono/issues](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues).
