Code Access Security (CAS) is not supported on Mono. In the past, we spent some time to implement this very complex scenario but it was never finished. With all the changes in the security system in .NET 4, we have decided not to continue working on this feature. You can still find the bits of the implementation in our code base as we haven't done removal of all related code but the code is disabled and not functional.
