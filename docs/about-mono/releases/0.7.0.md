Hey guys!

Mono 0.7 has been released.

It has been a long time since the last release of Mono (almost
three weeks).  We have made an incredible ammount of work in the past
three weeks.

## Highlights of this release

* The monoburg: BURS-instruction selector implemented (for our
    portable JIT engine).

* JIT engine works for very simple programs (Fibonacci works
    for instance).  It is about 30% faster running than the
    equivalent code compiled with Kaffe.

    The interesting part is that this was accomplished with the
    a minimum register allocator, and very simple monoburg
    rules, so there is a *lot* of room to improve here.

* The Interpreter has madured a lot.  Value Types are fully
    supported now;  We dropped the FFI dependency, as we now
    have our own code generator.

* The runtime has been expanded and extended as to support
    real file I/O (including console I/O).  So Hello World works
    in there.

* The compiler can generate code for most statements now; It
    also performs semantic analysis on most expressions.
    Creation of new objects is supported, access to parameters,
    fields and local variables works.  Method invocation works.
    Implicit type conversions, assignments and much more.

    Operator overloading is implemented, but broken on this
    release, hopefully this will be fixed soon.

    Delegates and Attributes are now declared and passed around,
    but no code generation for those exist yet.

* More classes (look for details).  Sergey and Paolo have been
    working on various classes in System.Reflection.Emit to get
    the compiler self-hosting.

* NUnit is now part of the distribution, so it should be
    trivial to write test cases (and if you want to help out,
    this is one way to do it, we really need more tests cases).

I am going to try to switch to Nick's JB for C# this week or next
week.  But the excitement of having the compiler deal with real C#
programs is too much to be contained, and I can not keep my hands of
the code generation in the compiler.

### Class Library Changes

## This list

Parts of this list of features were compiled by Alex by following
the CVS mailing list.  My deepest thanks to Alex for helping me out
with this.  I want to apologize for the missing features that I did
not document here, Mono is moving too fast to keep track of all the
changes.
