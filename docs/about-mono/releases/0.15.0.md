Hello,

I have just released Mono 0.15, we skipped version 0.14, because
it was only used internally.

## Administrivia

As usual, two packages were released.  You only need the first to
develop applications though:

    http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15.tar.gz

Runtime engine source code.
Binaries for the compiler and class libraries.

    http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.15.tar.gz

Source code for the compiler and the class libraries.

Instructions for recompiling the compiler and the
class libraries is included in mcs-0.13/INSTALL,
thanks to Alp for authoring this doc.

RPMS are available for Red Hat 7.3:

## Stats

## News

There are so many news in the past month, that it is very hard to
summarize it.  Basically: better, faster, more complete Mono.  I
have included my attempt at a summary:

* C# Compiler, from Martin Baulig:

    * Definite assignment support.
    * 50% faster compilation times.
    * Almost all bugs against the compiler closed.

* Tim Coleman and Web Services:

    * Tim has started to add support for Web Services.

* Runtime:

    * Dietmar has been working on our remoting support as well
    as Interop code.  Structure marshalling got complete
    now.

* Internationalization:

    * Rhys Weatherley author of Portable.NET has contributed
    his very complete internationalization code to the Mono
    class libraries.

* ASP.NET:

    * Many contributions from Patrik Torstensson to the
    HttpRuntime.  Gonzalo started to move the XSP page
    processor into the System.Web assembly.

    * Once Patrik commits the rest of the new code, it will
    be possible to use the regular Web servers people write
    as well as writing an Apache module.

    * Gaurav is back, and has been fixing and improving some of the
    existing Webform widgets.

* Sparc and PowerPC.

    * Mark Crichton updated the SPARC code for Mono, Radek
    updated the PowerPC port as well.

* ADO.NET

    * Rodrigo and Dan have maintained thing: the OleDB classes
    are starting to show signs of life with the LibGDA backend

* Windows.Forms:

    * Work is progressing on the WineLib-based implementation
    of the Windows.Forms.  The only way of making sure we
    can run all Windows.Forms apps on Linux.

* Resources

    * Dick checked in resource readers and writers.

* Tons of bug fixes.

    * Everywhere, really.

This time I had to put together packages, rpms, and release notes
myself, I apologize if I missed an important chunk of work, it is
really hard to read over a thousand commits and try to synthesize.
