Hello everyone,

A small bug fix release of the [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) runtime and SDK has been released.

This release only includes a few smaller bug fixes to our Http client as well as minor fixes to the C# compiler.

Specifically this release fixes some problems with Chunked encoding and a race condition on the Http client. The C# compiler would crash sometimes when reporting a delegate signature error.

These bugs were small but important to various users. If you are not a user of these facilities you do not need to upgrade, although it never hurts, and you will be a little bit happier as you dont need to worry every time you declare a delegate `Will the compiler crash on me?'

### Thanks

Gonzalo Paniagua for tracking down the networking problems that were hunting us and our users that reported the compiler bugs to bugzilla, Zoltan Varga for tracking down one of the runtime errors and Duncan Mak once again for building packages for everyone to download.
