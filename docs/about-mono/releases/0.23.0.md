Hello everyone,

A new release of Mono has been made, version 0.23.  This is only a
bug fix release, because we introduced an unfortunate bug in
reflection in version 0.22.  This should fix compilation for many of
you that had problems.

Packages and source code are avaliable from our web site:

Packages will be available shortly on Red Carpet as well.

Miguel
