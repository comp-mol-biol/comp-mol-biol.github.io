Mono for Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S allows developers to build C# .NET applications and games that run in the Game Partition and
gives them access to a comprehensive set of .NET APIs including support for .NET Standard 2.

Mono for Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S leverages Mono’s JIT compiler during development, allowing you to quickly iterate
when working on your game code. Release builds of your game will be fully statically compiled using
Mono’s Full Ahead of Time Compilation engine leveraging LLVM code generation libraries.

SDK includes Visual Studio project and build system as well as integrated managed debugger. SDK also includes support to compile all
needed managed code into a full self contained native library, easily integrated into native application/game using Mono embedding API's,
giving developers ability to extend existing native application/game using C#. SDK includes samples on how an embedded library could be
used to integrate C# code into native code bases.
