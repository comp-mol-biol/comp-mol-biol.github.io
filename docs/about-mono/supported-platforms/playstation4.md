Mono for PlayStation®4 allows developers to build native applications and
games in C# utilizing the comprehensive set of .NET APIs including support for
.NET Standard 2. Thanks to Mono's embedding API managed .NET code can easily
be linked into native C/C++ games, e.g. as a scripting engine for game logic.

The Mono for PlayStation®4 port is a free product but it is only accessible to
registered PlayStation®4 developers. To obtain a copy please submit a post in
[this PS4 DevNet forum thread](https://ps4.siedev.net/forums/thread/16145),
detailing your GitLab username and email address.

You need to access the PS4 DevNet from an IP address accepted by Sony or
you will get an access denied error.
