The Mono Project hosts a [public Jenkins instance](http://jenkins.mono-project.com/), which attempts to compile distribution packages for major GNU/Linux distributions for every commit made to the public Mono git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/mono/mono).

As of October 2018 we no longer offer a separate repository for installing these per-commit packages since they were rarely used.
We recommend to use the [Nightly Builds](/download/nightly/) channel instead.
