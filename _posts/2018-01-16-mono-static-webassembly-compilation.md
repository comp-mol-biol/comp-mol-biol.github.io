title: Mono and WebAssembly - Updates on Static Compilation

As you may know we have been working on [bringing Mono to the
WebAssembly platform](/news/2017/08/09/hello-webassembly).
As part of the effort we have been pursuing two strategies; one that
uses the new Mono IL interpreter to run managed code at runtime, and
one that uses full static (AOT) compilation to create one `.wasm` file
that can be executed natively by the browser.

We intend the former to be used for quickly reloading C# code and
prototyping and the latter for publishing your final application, with
all the optimizations enabled.  The interpreter work has now been
integrated into Mono’s source code and we are using it to develop,
port and tune the managed libraries to work on WebAssembly.

This post is about the progress that we have been making on doing
static compilation of .NET code to run on WebAssembly.

WebAssembly static compilation in Mono is orchestrated with the
`mono-wasm` command-line tool. This program takes IL assemblies as
input and generates a series of files in an output directory, notably
an `index.wasm` file containing the WebAssembly code for your
assemblies as well as all other dependencies (the Mono runtime, the C
library and the `mscorlib.dll` library).

    $ cat hello.cs
    class Hello {
      static int Main(string[] args) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("hello world!");
        return 0;
      }
    }
    $ mcs -nostdlib -noconfig -r:../../dist/lib/mscorlib.dll hello.cs -out:hello.exe
    $ mono-wasm -i hello.exe -o output
    $ ls output
    hello.exe        index.html        index.js        index.wasm        mscorlib.dll

`mono-wasm` uses a version of the Mono compiler that, given C#
assemblies, generates LLVM bitcode suitable to be passed to the LLVM
WebAssembly backend. Similarly, we have been building the Mono runtime
and a C library with a version of `clang` that also generates LLVM
WebAssembly bitcode.

Until recently, `mono-wasm` was linking all the bitcode into a single
LLVM module then performing the WebAssembly code generation on
it. While this created a functional `.wasm` file, this had the
downside of taking a significant amount of time (half a minute on a
recent MacBook Pro) every time we were building a project as a lot of
code was in play. Some of the code, the runtime bits and the
`mscorlib.dll` library, never changed and yet were still being
processed for WebAssembly code generation every time.

We were thrilled to hear in late November of last year that the LLVM
linker (`lld`) [was getting WebAssembly
support](https://lld.llvm.org/WebAssembly.html).

Since then, we changed our `mono-wasm` tool to perform incremental
compilation of project dependencies into separate `.wasm` files, and
we integrated `lld`’s new WebAssembly driver in the tool. Thanks to
this approach, we now perform WebAssembly code generation only when
required, and in our testing builds now complete in less than a second
once the dependencies (runtime bits and `mscorlib.dll`) have already
been compiled into WebAssembly.

Additionally, `mono-wasm` used to use the LLVM WebAssembly target to
create source files that would then be passed to the
[Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) toolchain to
create the `.wasm` code.  We have been testing the backend's ability
to generate `.wasm` object files directly (with the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm` triple) and so far it seems promising
enough that we changed `mono-wasm` accordingly. We also noticed a
slight decrease in build time.

|                        | Old toolchain | New toolchain (First Compile) | New toolchain (Rebuild)
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Full application build | ~40s          | ~30s                        | <1s                   |
| Hello World program    | ~40s          | <1s                         | <1s                   |

There is still a lot of work to do on bringing C# to WebAssembly, but
we are happy with this new approach and the progresses we are
making. Feel free to watch this space for further updates. You can
also track the work on the [mono-wasm GitHub
repository](https://github.com/lrz/mono-wasm).

For those of you that want to take this for a spin you can download a
[preview release](https://github.com/lrz/mono-wasm/releases), unzip
and run "make" in the samples.  This currently requires MacOS High
Sierra to run.
