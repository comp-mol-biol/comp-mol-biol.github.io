Today we are announcing the first preview release of Embeddinator-4000 for Android available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Embeddinator-4000/). The package also includes the previously released iOS support.

```bash
nuget install Embeddinator-4000
```

This will place `Embeddinator-4000.exe` into the `packages/Embeddinator-4000/tools` directory.

This release supports the following scenarios:
* Call C# code from Java or C
* Package a Xamarin.Android library project into an AAR package for use in Android Studio
  * Include Android layouts, drawables, assets, etc. from C# projects
  * Default linker behavior of `SdkOnly`
  * Generate AAR files on either Windows or OS X
* Use Xamarin.Forms' new embedding API to use Xamarin.Forms from Java
* Package a .NET library project into a JAR file for use from Java on desktop platforms
* Package a .NET library project into a `dylib`, `so`, or `dll` as appropriate per platform for use from C

For general usage, run Embeddinator on a compiled Android library assembly as follows:

```bash
mono Embeddinator-4000.exe -gen=Java -platform=Android -c YourAndroidLibrary.dll
```

This will output `YourAndroidLibrary.aar` for use in Android Studio.

In Android Studio, create a new module and choose `Import .JAR/.AAR package`:

Adding a dependency to the new module, will give Java access to your .NET code:
