Howto OpenBrowser
=================

Any versions of Mono available since 2007 will support opening a url by using Process.Start with a url, for example:

``` csharp
Process.Start ("http://www.google.com");
```

Older versions of Mono did not support this and have to manually do this. Here is how it used to be done in the past. This copes with a few different operating systems in \*older\* versions of Mono:

``` csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
 
public static bool OpenLink(string address) {
    try {
        int plat = (int) Environment.OSVersion.Platform;
        if ((plat != 4) && (plat != 128)) {
            // Use Microsoft's way of opening sites
            Process.Start(address);
        } else {
            // We're on Unix, try gnome-open (used by GNOME), then open
            // (used my MacOS), then Firefox or Konqueror browsers (our last
            // hope).
            string cmdline = String.Format("gnome-open {0} || open {0} || "+
                "firefox {0} || mozilla-firefox {0} || konqueror {0}", address);
            Process proc = Process.Start (cmdline);
 
            // Sleep some time to wait for the shell to return in case of error
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(250);
 
            // If the exit code is zero or the process is still running then
            // appearently we have been successful.
            return (!proc.HasExited || proc.ExitCode == 0);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // We don't want any surprises
        return false;
    }
}
```

If your program is meant to be run only under GNOME, you have a better and easier solution, however. It is suficient to call Gnome.Url::Show, as shown below:

``` csharp
using Gnome;
...
public void OpenMyProgramWebsite()
{
    Url.Show("http://websiteofmyproject/");
}
```
